# Traffic-Flow-Analysis-Task

This project is developed in **Python** and makes use of five core technologies. **OpenCV** is used for video processing, drawing lane dividers, and displaying the live output. **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** is applied for real-time vehicle detection, while **DeepSORT** ensures accurate object tracking so that each vehicle is counted only once. **Pandas** is utilized to store and export the traffic data into CSV format for further analysis. Finally, **NumPy** is employed to handle mathematical operations and array manipulations required during the processing.

In this project, vehicles moving across predefined lanes in a video are detected and tracked in real time. As each vehicle crosses the counting line, the system updates the count per lane and saves the results into a CSV file for further analysis.
